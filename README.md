# FizzBuzz

The subject of FizzBuzz as a coding exercise in interviews has come up a couple of times in conversations with colleagues.
After the first conversation I decided to have a little play around with some solutions. At some later point I thought I might 
put those solutions onto github. A later convesation reminded me that I never got around to doing that :0)

Jeff Attwood wrote an [article][codinghorror] in which he talks about the problem of assessing coding ability in interviews.
He talks about a class of 'FizzBuzz' problems based on the [children's game][wikipedia]. The problem is also described [here][c2]
; along with link's to Jeff's discussion and others.

I find exercises like this in interview situations interesting; especially if there is no context to indicate what area of 
knowledge or technical expertise the interviewer is seaking to assess. Playing with the problem, with this thinking in the back
of my mind, lead to the different solutions. I expect I'll throw a few more in as and when I decide to take some time out and play
with FizzBuzz again :0)
